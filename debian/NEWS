gdb (7.7.1+dfsg-3) unstable; urgency=medium

  WARNING: gdb will use Python 3 by jessie+1 (Debian 9).
  
  Exact details still need to be worked out, but we intend to make this
  the default soon after jessie is released (if not before).

  Please update your Python scripts to work on both Python 2 and 3 as soon
  as possible.
